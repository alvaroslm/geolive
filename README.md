## Synopsis

Geolocalized memory data storage and search engine (with 3D visualization). 
Earth is split in projected triangle slices from a regular icosahedron. The triangles are further subdivided as needed, as new data is inserted in the nodes. Fast searches (point or circle area) can be performed in the tree thus formed.
Sample data comes from geolocated tweets. You can use the mouse to rotate the Earth and some keys to test the functionality (see usage in the command line).  

## Installation

Unzip the data.zip (and glut32-lib.zip) and compile with VS2013. It should compile on other platforms too with the OpenGL utility library (GLUT).
